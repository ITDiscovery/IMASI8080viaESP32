# IMASI8080viaESP32

This project creates an emulator of an **IMSAI 8080** front panel experience using an **ESP32** microcontroller. It leverages TTL shift registers to connect a large number of DIP switches and LED bars via a custom BlinklinLights PCB. While this project's goal is to create a complete representation, the software and hardware can be leveraged for many other uses.

---

## üåü Design Goals

1.  Use the **ESP32** and add the required I/O via **74HCT165** (input) and **74LS595** (output) shift registers. (The AVR128 was dropped due to the need to leverage external memory, which made the whole design too slow).
2.  Enable connectivity to a **Raspberry Pi** for enhanced functionality.
3.  Create smaller "Blinkin Boards" to extend the display, such as a 7-Segment module to show address and data bus values.
4.  Allow for emulation of other classic machines, such as a **PDP-8**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build and Setup Instructions

This section outlines the steps required to build and flash the firmware for the **RevB** (Current Working) version.

### 1. Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed on your development machine:

* **Arduino IDE** (or PlatformIO).
* **ESP32 Board Support Package** for the Arduino IDE.
* **Git** for cloning the repository.

### 2. Required Libraries

The project relies on these libraries, which must be installed via the Arduino Library Manager:

| Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`SPI`** | Communication with SPI devices (e.g., SD Card) |
| **`SD`** | Handling the SD card for disk images |
| **`WiFi`** | Network connectivity |
| **`Adafruit_NeoPixel`** | Controls the built in LED on the ESP32|

### 3. Build and Flash Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ITDiscovery/IMASI8080viaESP32.git](https://github.com/ITDiscovery/IMASI8080viaESP32.git)
    cd IMASI8080viaESP32
    ```
2.  **Open the `.ino` file** in the Arduino IDE.
3.  **Configure Board Settings:** Select the appropriate ESP32 board in the Arduino IDE's **Tools** menu.
    > **‚ö†Ô∏è SD Card Note:** This project uses a custom pin mapping (Pins 10-13) for the SD Card SPI interface. If you are using the **Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero** variant, you may need to modify the `pins_arduino.h` file.
4.  **Configure Network:** Update the `ssid` and `password` variables in the `.ino` file with your preferred Wi-Fi network credentials (if using the WiFi feature).
5.  **Compile and Upload:** Click the **Upload** button to compile the code and flash it to your ESP32.

## üèóÔ∏è Hardware Revisions

The project has undergone several hardware revisions:

* **AVR Hardware (Dropped):** The initial design using an AVR was dropped due to speed issues caused by the need for external memory. Early concepts using the **AVR128DB28 Flash** were abandoned because newly posted specifications showed only a **1K write cycle endurance**. While using an external **23LC512 SRAM** was considered (and would have allowed for an **AVR64DB28**), this approach was too slow and required an additional 4 pins. The decision was made to switch to the ESP32 platform.
* **RevA:** Boards would require too many modifications to function.
* **RevB:** This version requires a mod to go from Pin 1 of U2 to Pin 24 of H3, and it used a smaller footprint AVR128DB28.
* **RevC (Current Design):** Board has been heavily bodged to accomdate an ESP32 and a 5V-to-3.3V transceiver, but worked well during AVR development.
* **RevD (Future Design):** Has the ESP32-S3-Zero and the transciever designed onto the board. The board has not been produced or tested.

## üîå Pin Definitions and Wiring

The following tables detail the pin connections for the ESP32 and the external 40-pin headers (H1 and H2).

### ESP32 Pin Mapping (To H1/H2 Headers)

| **SW Clock (CP)** | 37 | 5 (`SclockPin`) |
| **SW Data (Q7)** | 35 | 4 (`SdataPin`) |
| **SW Latch (PL!)** | 33 | 6 (`SlatchPin`) |

> **Note:** As the only input line, **SWData** must be **level converted**. The low output levels (3.3V) of the remaining signals will be respected by the TTL inputs.

## üíª I/O Implementation

The emulation implements "new" hardware through the `i8080_in` and `i8080_out` functions, which use a `switch/case` based on the port number.

### Currently Implemented Ports

* **Port 0x00 (In):** Sends back `0x00`.
* **Port 0x01 (In/Out):** Handles `term_in`/`term_out` for the primary terminal interface.
* **Port 0x08, 0x09, 0x0A (I/O):** Disk Controller interface.
* **Port 0x10, 0x11 (I/O):** 2SIO Port 1 (needs to be routed to sockets instead of serial).
* **Port 0x06, 0x07 (I/O):** Cassette Port (Not implemented).
* **Port 0xFF (Out):** Writes **4 bits** to control the `User4 - User1` LEDs.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è ToDo List (Current Priorities)

This list focuses on tasks required to achieve a complete, functional IMSAI 8080 replica:

1.  **Floppy Disk Write implementation.** (Current Major Focus)
2.  The code needs **refactoring**, specifically in the **I/O handling routines.**
3.  Look into adding support for the optional **8K BASIC interpreter.**
4.  I can now add **WiFi via SSH** to this.
5.  Needs lots of **speed ups** (I/O refactoring will help with this).
6.  Review **pull request #45** (LED refresh issue).

---

## ‚ú® Future Features (Secondary Goals)

These are secondary goals that can be addressed once the core IMSAI 8080 emulation is complete and stable:

* Would be nice to have it connectable to a **Raspberry Pi**.
* Make smaller **Blinkin Boards to extend:** Such as a 7-Segment to show address and data bus values.
* Would be nice to allow it to emulate other blinkinlight platforms (e.g., PDP-8).
