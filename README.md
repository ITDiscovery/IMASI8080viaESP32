# IMASI8080viaESP32

This project creates an emulator of an **IMSAI 8080** front panel experience using an **ESP32** microcontroller. It leverages TTL shift registers to connect a large number of DIP switches and LED bars via a custom BlinklinLights PCB. While this project's goal is to create a complete representation, the software and hardware can be leveraged for many other uses.

---

## üåü Design Goals

1.  Use the **ESP32** and add the required I/O via **74HCT165** (input) and **74LS595** (output) shift registers. (The AVR128 was dropped due to the need to leverage external memory, which made the whole design too slow).
2.  Enable connectivity to a **Raspberry Pi** for enhanced functionality.
3.  Create smaller "Blinkin Boards" to extend the display, such as a 7-Segment module to show address and data bus values.
4.  Allow for emulation of other classic machines, such as a **PDP-8**.

## I. Core Emulation Features

The project delivers a stable, high-performance emulation of the Intel 8080 CPU and key S-100 bus components, primarily running **CP/M 2.2**.

### üåü System Stability and Performance

* **CPU Core:** The **8080 CPU** core is stable, running at an emulated speed of approximately **~2 MHz**.
* **Operating Systems:** Successfully boots and runs **CP/M 2.2 B23** and disk-based **Microsoft BASIC**.
* **Application Success:** The system is capable of running complex, disk-intensive software like **ZORK I** and utilities such as **PIP.COM**.

### üåê Networking and I/O

* **Telnet Integration:** Telnet communication is correctly mapped to the standard **88-2SIO Port B** for network I/O.
* **Inter-Core Communication:** Uses FreeRTOS queues for stable data exchange between the ESP32's Core 0 (Emulation) and Core 1 (Networking).

### ‚è±Ô∏è MITS 88-VI Real-Time Clock (RTC) Emulation

The system accurately emulates the MITS 88-VI RTC card, providing real-world time to CP/M applications.

* **Time Source:** Leverages the ESP32's system clock, synchronized via an **NTP server**.
* **Functionality:** Supports both reading the current time and writing a new time back to update the ESP32's system clock.
* **Interrupts:** Emulates the advanced **periodic vectored interrupt controller** (Port `0xFE`), a critical feature for enabling time-slicing in multi-user operating systems.

### üíæ Storage Persistence

* **Disk Write Mechanism:** Implemented with a **Write Back Mechanism** that saves changes from the PSRAM buffer back to the SD card, allowing for persistent modifications to disk images.
* **Hard Disk Wedge:** A special wedge is in place to allow the read of a **Z80Pack 1.1Mb file** to patch CP/M and mount the file system as Read-Only.

Essentially, this system has the CPU board, an 88-SIO (FTDI port), an 88-2SIO (to USB Serial and Telnet), an 88-DCDD Floppy Controller with 2 360K Drives,
and an 88-VI/RTC. A 88-4PIO Hard Drive is also emulated, but still buggy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build and Setup Instructions

This section outlines the steps required to build and flash the firmware for the **RevB** (Current Working) version.

### 1. Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed on your development machine:

* **Arduino IDE** (or PlatformIO).
* **ESP32 Board Support Package** for the Arduino IDE.
* **Git** for cloning the repository.

### 2. Required Libraries

The project relies on these libraries, which must be installed via the Arduino Library Manager:

| Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`SPI`** | Communication with SPI devices (e.g., SD Card) |
| **`SD`** | Handling the SD card for disk images |
| **`WiFi`** | Network connectivity |

## üèóÔ∏è Hardware Revisions

The project has undergone several hardware revisions:

* **AVR Hardware (Dropped):** The initial design using an AVR was dropped due to speed issues caused by the need for external memory. Early concepts using the **AVR128DB28 Flash** were abandoned because newly posted specifications showed only a **1K write cycle endurance**. While using an external **23LC512 SRAM** was considered (and would have allowed for an **AVR64DB28**), this approach was too slow and required an additional 4 pins. The decision was made to switch to the ESP32 platform.
* **RevA:** Boards would require too many modifications to function.
* **RevB:** This version requires a mod to go from Pin 1 of U2 to Pin 24 of H3, and it used a smaller footprint AVR128DB28.
* **RevC (Current Design):** Board has been heavily bodged to accomdate an ESP32 and a 5V-to-3.3V transceiver, but worked well during AVR development.
* **RevD (Future Design):** Has the ESP32-S3-Zero and the transciever designed onto the board. The board has not been produced or tested.

## üíª I/O Implementation

The emulation implements "new" hardware through the `i8080_in` and `i8080_out` functions, which use a `switch/case` based on the port number.

### Currently Implemented Ports

* **Port 0x00 (In):** Sends back `0x00`.
* **Port 0x01 (In/Out):** Handles `term_in`/`term_out` for the primary terminal interface.
* **Port 0x08, 0x09, 0x0A (I/O):** Disk Controller interface.
* **Port 0x10, 0x11 (I/O):** 2SIO Port 1 (needs to be routed to sockets instead of serial).
* **Port 0x06, 0x07 (I/O):** Cassette Port (Not implemented).
* **Port 0xFF (Out):** Writes **4 bits** to control the `User4 - User1` LEDs.
